   <h1>The Other Page</h1>
   <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

   <h1>HTML Examples</h1>
   <h2>Heading Tags</h2>
   Text documents are often broken up into several sections and subsections. Each section is 
   usually prefaced with a short title or heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the 
   section it precedes. For instance this paragraph is preceded by the heading Heading Tags. The 
   font of the section headings are usually larger and bolder than their subsection headings. This 
   document uses headings to introduce topics such as HTML Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc. 
   HTML heading tags can be used to format plain text so that it renders in a browser as large 
   headings. There are 6 heading tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading
    and h6 is the smallest heading.
